## Fixed

### Ledger `entry_type` vs `type` field mismatch crashed tenant financial timeline

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07 (during Owner Financial Workspace redesign)
- **Area:** [[Backend]] — `financial-timeline-service.ts`
- **Symptom:** Runtime throw whenever a tenant had any `tenant_financial_ledger` rows.
- **Root cause:** Service referenced `entry_type`, but the actual Prisma field on `tenant_financial_ledger` is `type`.
- **Fix:** Corrected field reference in `backend-next/src/services/payments/financial-timeline-service.ts`.
- **Related:** [[Features]] (Owner financial workspace)

### Raw SQL calculators used `o.amount` instead of `o.total_amount`, silently dropping late fees

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07
- **Area:** [[Database]] / [[Backend]]
- **Symptom:** Owner and tenant surfaces showed different Outstanding/Overdue/Future Credit for the same tenant.
- **Root cause:** ~6 independently duplicated outstanding/overdue calculators across surfaces; two used the wrong column in raw SQL.
- **Fix:** Introduced `financial-read-model-service.ts` composing existing services; migrated consumers. See `docs/business-logic/financial-consistency-investigation-report.md` and [[Decisions]] ADR-001.

### Typing in the Expenses Workspace search box unmounted the whole tab (looked like a full page reload)

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07-18
- **Area:** [[Frontend]] — `ExpensesTab.tsx`
- **Symptom:** Every keystroke in the expense search box blanked the entire tab (dashboard, filter bar, the search input itself) into a loading skeleton, dropping input focus.
- **Root cause:** `search` was part of the React Query key, so every keystroke produced a brand-new, never-cached query key; React Query v5's `isLoading` is `true` whenever there's no cached data for the *current* key, and `ExpensesTab.tsx` gated its entire render on `isLoading`.
- **Fix:** Added `placeholderData: keepPreviousData` to the list query so the previous result set stays mounted while a new key fetches in the background, instead of unmounting into `TabSkeleton`.

### Export button threw "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'export')" in production only

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07-18
- **Area:** [[Frontend]] — `ExpensesTab.tsx`
- **Symptom:** Clicking Export in the deployed app threw immediately; worked fine in `vite dev`.
- **Root cause:** Not a stale deploy (verified by diffing the live production chunk against a fresh local build — identical). Vite's production bundler mis-transforms `const { blob, filename } = await import(...).then((m) => m.expenseService.export(...))` — its chunk-preload wrapper ends up destructuring `blob`/`filename` off the *module namespace* (which only has `expenseService` on it) instead of the `.then()` result, so `.expenseService` reads as `undefined` before `.export` is ever reached.
- **Fix:** Split the import resolution from the destructuring (`const { expenseService } = await import(...); const { blob, filename } = await expenseService.export(...)`) — verified by inspecting the compiled bundle before/after.

### Cron renewal activation produced SIGNED agreements with no rent obligations

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07-19
- **Area:** [[Backend]] — `agreement-lifecycle-service.ts` (`AgreementLifecycleService.activateScheduledRenewals`)
- **Symptom:** A renewal agreement activated by the daily lifecycle cron (effective-date-triggered, as opposed to tenant-signed) ended up `SIGNED` with zero `rent_obligations` rows — no rent was ever billed for that agreement until someone noticed and ran a manual repair script.
- **Root cause:** Two independent paths can transition a renewal draft `DRAFT → SIGNED`: `AgreementRenewalSigningService.signRenewalAgreement` (manual, tenant e-signs) and `AgreementLifecycleService.activateScheduledRenewals` (cron, effective-date arrives with no signature required). Only the manual path called `agreementRentScheduleService.generateForAgreementInTx` after marking the agreement `SIGNED`; the cron path never did, so it silently produced an agreement with no billing schedule.
- **Fix:** `activateScheduledRenewals` now calls `agreementRentScheduleService.generateForAgreementInTx(tx, draft.id)` inside the same transaction as the status transition (mirroring the manual path exactly), and calls `financialLifecycleService.notifyActivated(...)` post-commit for cache/SSE parity. The class-level doc-comment claiming the cron "must never create obligations" was narrowed to describe only the expiry-tracking walk, not `activateScheduledRenewals`, which intentionally mirrors manual signing's financial writes.
- **Tests:** `tests/agreement-renewal-activation.test.ts` — new case `"generates the rent schedule for the activated draft inside the same transaction"`.

### Manual renewal signing did not enforce the unpaid security deposit check that cron activation already had

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07-19
- **Area:** [[Backend]] — `agreement-renewal-signing-service.ts` (`AgreementRenewalSigningService.signRenewalAgreement`)
- **Symptom:** A tenant could e-sign a renewal agreement (manual path) even when the renewal's `SECURITY_DEPOSIT` top-up obligation was still `PENDING`/`PARTIAL` — the cron activation path already blocked this exact scenario (`RENEWAL_ACTIVATION_BLOCKED` event), but the manual signing path had no equivalent check.
- **Root cause:** The two activation paths (manual signing vs. cron) were built with different validation coverage — cron's `activateScheduledRenewals` queries for an unpaid `SECURITY_DEPOSIT` obligation on the draft before activating; `signRenewalAgreement` never did the equivalent query.
- **Fix:** Added the same `rent_obligations.findFirst({ obligation_type: "SECURITY_DEPOSIT", status: {in:["PENDING","PARTIAL"]}, is_superseded:false, agreement_id })` check inside `signRenewalAgreement`'s transaction, right after the existing move-out check. Throws a new `SECURITY_DEPOSIT_UNPAID` (409) `AgreementRenewalSigningError` before any status mutation, matching the structured-error pattern already used for the other five precondition checks in this method.
- **Tests:** `tests/agreement-renewal-signing-service.test.ts` — new cases `"blocks signing when an unpaid security deposit obligation exists..."` and `"allows signing when there is no unpaid security deposit obligation"`. Also fixed a latent gap in `tests/agreement-rules-snapshot.test.ts`'s separate `mockPrisma` (missing a `rent_obligations` mock entirely — surfaced by this change since it's the first test to exercise that code path against that particular mock).

### Cron renewal activation had no transition safeguards, and two renewal chain-mutation call sites could race into an inconsistent state

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07-19
- **Area:** [[Backend]] — `agreement-lifecycle-service.ts` (`activateScheduledRenewals`), `renewal-offer-service.ts` (`acceptOffer`)
- **Symptom:** Cron activation (`activateScheduledRenewals`) could activate a renewal draft even when its predecessor was no longer in a renewable status (e.g. `TERMINATED`/`VOID`), even when the tenant had an active move-out request in progress, or even when the draft's own lifecycle metadata (rent/duration/dates) was incomplete — none of these were checked, even though the sibling manual-signing and manual-draft-creation services already enforce all three. Separately, `RenewalOfferService.acceptOffer` checked `offer.status !== "SENT"` *before* opening its transaction (a stale read) and linked the predecessor → successor via an `updateMany` whose `.count` was never checked — a losing concurrent acceptance would silently create an orphaned, unlinked successor `Agreement` instead of failing.
- **Root cause:** Both `activateScheduledRenewals` and `acceptOffer` were the two remaining call sites in this subsystem that predate the locked-read + conditional-`updateMany`-with-count-check pattern already established by `agreement-renewal-signing-service.ts` and `agreement-renewal-service.ts` (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, then a conditional `updateMany`, then a count check that throws on mismatch). Both used unconditional `update()` calls or an unchecked `updateMany()`, so a concurrent writer touching the same predecessor/draft pair between the initial read and the write could silently corrupt the renewal chain.
- **Fix:** `activateScheduledRenewals` now checks (in order) predecessor renewability (`isCurrentAgreementStatus`), an active move-out request, and `assertAgreementLifecycleComplete` on the draft — logging `RENEWAL_ACTIVATION_BLOCKED` and skipping, same as the existing unpaid-deposit block, rather than throwing. Its transaction now acquires `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locks on both the predecessor and draft rows, and both status-mutating writes became conditional `updateMany` calls with a `.count !== 1` check that throws (rolling back the transaction) if the chain changed since the pre-transaction read. `RenewalOfferService.acceptOffer` now acquires the same lock on the predecessor, re-reads the offer status fresh inside the transaction (closing the TOCTOU window), and checks the predecessor-link `updateMany`'s count, throwing `CONFLICT: A renewal was already accepted for this agreement` on a losing race instead of silently proceeding.
- **Tests:** `tests/agreement-renewal-activation.test.ts` — new cases for predecessor-not-renewable, active-move-out, and concurrent-chain-change (updateMany count 0). `tests/renewal-offer-service.test.ts` — new cases for the orphaned-successor race and the in-transaction status re-check.

### `RenewalOfferService.expireStaleOffers()` was fully implemented but never called from anywhere

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07-19
- **Area:** [[Backend]] — `renewal-offer-service.ts` (`expireStaleOffers`), `agreement-lifecycle-service.ts` (`processDailyLifecycle`)
- **Symptom:** Renewal offers past their `offer_expires_at` never transitioned to `EXPIRED` — they stayed `DRAFT`/`SENT` indefinitely. The method's own docstring claimed "Called by lifecycle cron," but grep confirmed zero callers anywhere in the codebase.
- **Root cause:** The method was implemented (bulk `updateMany` marking stale `DRAFT`/`SENT` offers `EXPIRED`) but never wired into `AgreementLifecycleService.processDailyLifecycle`, the one cron entry point this subsystem has.
- **Fix:** `processDailyLifecycle` now calls `renewalOfferService.expireStaleOffers()` once per run (wrapped in try/catch, non-fatal, consistent with the existing WhatsApp-template-health-check error handling in the same method), and records the count on a new `AgreementLifecycleSummary.offers_expired` field.
- **Also fixed while touching this test file:** `tests/agreement-renewal-activation.test.ts` had two `vi.mock(...)` calls using paths relative to the *test* file (`"./agreement-renewal-notification-service"`) instead of the actual module's location (`src/services/tenants/`) — Vitest resolves relative mock paths against the file calling `vi.mock`, so neither mock ever intercepted the real module. `processDailyLifecycle` tests were silently making real WhatsApp Business API calls (visible as `whatsapp.template_health.fetch_failed` errors in stderr, swallowed by the method's own try/catch) instead of using the mocked no-op. Fixed both to use the `@/src/services/tenants/...` path alias, matching every other correctly-working mock in the same file.
- **Tests:** `tests/agreement-renewal-activation.test.ts` — new case `"expires stale renewal offers as part of the daily lifecycle run"`.

### Renewal WhatsApp reminders permanently skip a stage if the daily cron misses its exact trigger day

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07-19
- **Area:** [[Backend]] — `renewal-status-service.ts` (`determineRenewalStage`)
- **Symptom:** If the daily lifecycle cron didn't run on the exact day an agreement hit 30/15 days-until-expiry or 7/`grace_period_days` days-overdue (an outage, a deploy window, a transient failure), that reminder stage was never sent for that agreement — by the next cron run, the day counter had moved past the exact value the equality check required.
- **Root cause:** `determineRenewalStage` used `===` exact-day matching for all four milestone stages, with no notion of "already past this point but haven't sent it yet."
- **Fix:** Converted the four milestone checks to inclusive threshold bands (`30_DAY_REMINDER`: 16-30 days left, `15_DAY_REMINDER`: 1-15, `7_DAY_OVERDUE`: ≥7 days overdue, `30_DAY_CRITICAL`: ≥grace-period days overdue, checked first). Safe because delivery-layer idempotency (`whatsapp_logs.idempotency_key`, unique per `(stage, agreementId)`) already guarantees exactly-once send even if a stage matches on several consecutive runs. `EXPIRY_DAY_ALERT` and `EXPIRED_RENT_OVERDUE` were deliberately left as exact/state checks — see [[Decisions]] ADR-014 for why broadening them would have collided with the existing `EXPIRED_RENT_OVERDUE` fallback.
- **Tests:** `tests/whatsapp-renewal-notification.test.ts` — new cases for a caught-up 30-day reminder, 15-day-over-30-day priority once inside the tighter window, and a caught-up 7-day-overdue alert.

### Tenant Financials "Payment Due Soon" card showed the amount from one obligation and the due date from a different, already-paid one

- **Status:** fixed
- **Found:** 2026-07-20
- **Area:** [[Frontend]] — `frontend-v2/src/portal/pages/TenantFinancialsPage.tsx` (`financialHealth` useMemo, ORANGE state)
- **Symptom:** A tenant whose current billing cycle was fully paid, but who had a small early/extra payment land on a *future*, not-yet-due obligation (flipping it from `UPCOMING` to `PARTIAL`), saw the home dashboard's Rent Status card and the Financials page's hero card both report "payment pending" with an amount — expected, since that obligation genuinely has an outstanding balance — but the Financials page's due-date subtext ("Due 5 Jul 2026") referenced the already-fully-paid current cycle, not the obligation the displayed amount actually came from (which was due 5 Aug 2026). Confirmed against live data: `rent_obligations` showed June and July rent `PAID` in full, and August rent `PARTIAL` (₹1 of ₹8,500 paid, due 2026-08-05) — the ₹8,499 "Amount Due" was correctly August's, but the date shown belonged to July.
- **Root cause:** The ORANGE-state subtext sourced its due date from `currentInstallment` — a locally-computed match for "the installment whose `period_start`/`period_end` contains today" — while the amount above it came from `readModel.current_payable_amount` (the canonical `FinancialReadModelService` sum of all non-`UPCOMING` outstanding obligations, regardless of due date). These two are not the same obligation whenever today falls inside an already-settled cycle but a *different*, later obligation is the one actually carrying the outstanding balance — the code's own comment stated the card should be "sourced from the canonical FinancialReadModel... not recomputed from local due-date math," but the subtext line did exactly that.
- **Fix:** The subtext now finds the earliest `due_date` among `readModel.items` filtered to the same condition `current_payable_amount` itself is summed over (`legacy_status !== 'UPCOMING' && outstanding > 0`) — the date now always belongs to the same obligation(s) the displayed amount is drawn from.
- **Note:** The underlying "why is anything pending at all" business question — a `PARTIAL` obligation counts toward `current_payable_amount` "regardless of due date" per that field's own documented contract, even when the payment landing on it was for a small/incidental amount well before the obligation's due date — was left as-is; changing that semantic is a deliberate financial-logic call (it's a shared field consumed by both owner and tenant surfaces) and was out of scope for this display-only fix.

## Open / known issues

> See also `docs/known-issues.md` for the maintained list of known drift/gaps in `docs/`.

- **Manual ledger POST route validates against the wrong enum values.** `/api/tenants/[id]/financial-ledger` only accepts `DEPOSIT/TOPUP/DEDUCTION/REFUND/CORRECTION`, none of which exist in the real `FinancialLedgerReason` Prisma enum. Left untouched as out-of-scope during the 2026-07 financial workspace redesign — worth fixing if that route is ever actually exercised.
- **No live-database audit done** for tenants with simultaneous Outstanding + Future Credit predating the future-credit-auto-consumption fix (`cf88ce94`). Needs an explicit user-run query.
